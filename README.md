# Mindustry Java Mod To Introduce Earthquakes and Asteroids To The Game

This mod was created because we felt that Mindustry can become quite monotonous after some time. Although the gameplay loop increases in difficulty, it essentially remains the same: you enter a sector, build defenses, and defend your core. Aside from unlocking new structures, not much else changes.

We thought that adding RNG-based events to the game would introduce new challenges and force players to adapt in different ways.

# Functionality

*(Note: This mod only works when at least one destructible block is placed. It does not affect core blocks.)*

- Adds destructive random events:
  - An asteroid that not only destroys the blocks it hits, but also triggers a “planet invasion” (meaning blocks from other planets spawn in the crater left by the asteroid). It can also bring ores.
  - An earthquake that has a chance to destroy blocks around its epicenter, depending on its size and strength.

# Instructions for Using the Mod

*Note: The JAR files are available in the Releases tab.*

1. Once the mod is built, press **Windows + R** and type `%APPDATA%`.
2. This will open a folder. Navigate to the `Mindustry` folder, then open the `mods` folder.
3. Paste the downloaded JAR file into that folder.
